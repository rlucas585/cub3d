'strerror' and 'perror' are functions I've never seen before, allowed for this
project. They are in the library <stdio.h>

char	*strerror(int errnum);
'strerror' function takes an error number argument 'errnum' and returns a
pointer to the corresponding message string.
'perr'

void	perror(const char *s);
'perror' finds the error message that corresponds to current value of global
variable 'errno', and writes it, followed by a newline, to the standard error
file description (2). If argument 's' is non-NULL and doesn't point to null,
this string is prepended to the message string and separated from it by a colon
and space (``: ''), otherwise only the error message string is printed.


'exit' is also a new function, defined in the library <stdlib.h>.
 
 void	exit(int status);
 exit() performs several functions: calls all functions registered with the
 atexit() function, in reverse order of registration; flushes all open output
 streams; closes all open streams; unlinks all files created with tmpfile()
 function.
